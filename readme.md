An online game with a rust backend

This is a work in progress and does not have any concept whatsoever yet.
The whole thing is more of a proof of concept at the moment, as I am interested
in exploring the possibilities of running a rust multiplayer gameserver 
with a browser frontend.

If you have any exiting ideas on what the gameplay should actually be, let me know through an issue! :)
